# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
This data is initially from Kaggle.com. 

This is the first project suggested from Dacon, a platform that provides a transparent data competition. I am participating in Dacon's Data Analysis Bootcamp for college students. My purpose of this project is to start python for machine learning. 

This project will be proceeded with python.

After this project, I expect to gain more skills and knowledge in data analysis.
