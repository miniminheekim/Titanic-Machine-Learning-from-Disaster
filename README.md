## Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
This data is initially from Kaggle.com. 

This is the first project suggested from Dacon, a platform that provides a transparent data competition. I am participating in Dacon's Data Analysis Bootcamp for college students. My purpose of this project is to start python for machine learning. 

This project will be proceeded with python.

After this project, I expect to gain more skills and knowledge in machine learning.

## How I played with the data
I learned very basics of how to use Python. I learned how to explore the data(EDA: Exploritory Data Analysis), make a decision tree and how its depth affects the result of prediction. I tried to visualize the decision tree but, it won't work on Jupyter or Spyder. So, I tried that on Google Colab and it worked.
I made a decision tree with maximum depth of 4 and tested it on the test data. My AUC came out to be 0.80540 which seemed to be impressive with these simple codes.
